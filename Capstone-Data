2. Data
2.1 Demographical Data
The "German Federal Office for Statistics" (DESTATIS) provide on their website statistics on many demographic aspects:

Unfortunatly, most statistics show information on a geographically aggregated level only. Only few statistics allow a 
drilldown down to the community-level (in German "Gemeinde").
Among those more detailed reports, one could be identified that for each individual community lists:
    - Community-ID and Community Name
    - area in square-kilometers
    - population
    - population per square-kilometer
    - Geographical longitude and latitude
and other attibutes that can be omitted for this project.
The report is current as of end 2018, and consequently should provide up to date information.
Also, a high level of accuracy can be expected due to its official source.
This is the link to the report in excel-format:

2.2 Fastfood Restaurants
Foursquare Labs Inc. is a technology enteprise that provides information on many different kinds of venues, mostly related
to food, but considering other places of interest as well. 
Users of Foursquare's web-app can provide their feedback on venues at any time, as well as suggest new venues. Presumably, 
this feedback does not provide a totally concise and accurate view  on a community's venues, but still should be acceptable, 
also considering the lack of alternative free data sources.

Venues can be searched by category and geographical data (longitude/latitude) via an API: 

  https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/api/venues/search

From their "category page", the id for "Fastfood Restaurants" can be retrieved:

  https://developer.foursquare.com/docs/resources/categories

For request made via API, results are provided as a json-file. Per request, a maximum of 50 venues are returned. This needs 
to be considered when analyzing results. Any resulting number of venues above 49 is unreliable since a higher amount of results 
just could have been capped by 50.
