1. Introduction/Business Problem
An interntional fastfood chain plans to enter the German market. So far, they are not present in Germany.
They engage a data scientist to search for the most promising communities to build new fastfood restaurants.
In detail, they ask for an recommendation on the communities for 2 pilot restaurants.
For logistical reasons, restaurants should be in the same geographical region within Germany.
The decision for the restaurants should be based on 
	- demographical data, 
	- as well as analysis of already existing fastfood restaurants.
The analysis especially should look into in how far demographics and existing fastfood restaurants can be 
related to each other.
As a result, communities should be identfied that according to their demographic specifics currently are 
served with a number of fastfood restaurants below average.
